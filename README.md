# wexdusto

It asks for the area codes you do want to invade - and then the program writes to the wexdustconfig.txt properly including all the codes you didn't specify.

Include a space between each code. 

I would also make it the reverse input - like enter in the codes you don't want to invade, but for me personally, if there is only a few places I don't want to invade, I don't mind just adding them to the block list manually :)
